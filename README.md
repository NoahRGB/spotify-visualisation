# Spotify API Testing
A small app using the Spotify API to display some basic information about a Spotify user and showing their top 100 most listened to tracks. 
Something that always annoyed me was that you can only see your top songs at the end of the year, so this allows you to view it at any time.

UI is minimal and is not meant to be 100% polished, this was just some basic testing to explore the API and retireve most played songs
